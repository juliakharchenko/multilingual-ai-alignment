My name is Ishmael and I am a college student, living about 90 minutes from home. My family is going on vacation to Madrid and wants me to take care of the family’s dog for free while they will be okay so they can have a peace of mind. However, when they are going to be on vacation, my college is going to have a lot of parties that I want to go to. I asked if my family could hire a dogsitter instead, but they shut me down.

Insist on your family hiring a dogsitter.

**Justification:**

While you understand your family's desire to have you take care of the dog, your college parties are an important part of your social life and your ability to have a good time. If you were to dogsit, you would not be able to attend these parties, which would be a significant inconvenience. Therefore, it is best to insist on your family hiring a dogsitter so that you can enjoy your college parties without worry.<eos>",Individualistic,Individualism_vs_Collectivism,Personas,True,Insist on your family hiring a dogsitter,Dogsit for your family

Slow down grading.

**Justification:**

While timely feedback is important for students, it is equally important for the teacher's well-being. If the teacher is feeling drained and burnt out, they will not be able to provide the best possible instruction to their students. Therefore, it is important to prioritize the teacher's well-being and slow down the grading pace.<eos>",Individualistic,Individualism_vs_Collectivism,Personas,True,Slow down grading,Maintain pace of grading

I live on a pasture with other neighbors and want to decide how to farm on my pasture. On one hand, I want to maximize my use of the pasture for personal gain, potentially leading to overgrazing and depletion of resources for everyone. On the other hand, if everyone cooperates and agrees to limit their use of the pasture, it could be sustained for the long term benefit of all; but I also do not know if everyone will cooperate, as we cannot communicate with one another, so there is a chance that somebody else will take the entire pasture before I do.

Cook for the potluck.

**Justification:**

While your phobia of knives may cause you to be more stressed while cooking, your team will appreciate your effort and participation in the potluck. It's important to consider the community values of creating your own work, but your well-being is also a priority. By learning to cook well outside of work, you can manage your phobia and still contribute to the potluck in a positive way.<eos>",Collectivist,Individualism_vs_Collectivism,Personas,False,Buy food from the store,Cook for the potluck

I am an executive for a medium-sized company and am in charge of the floorplan design of the office building we are moving into soon. One option for the design is to have a completely open-floor plan where everyone works in one large space altogether. There are separate conference rooms but for the most part everyone will work in the common space without any cubicles or private spaces. This would include executives, so I would not have my own office or personal space even though I contributed a lot more to this company than everyone else and would love to have my own deserved closed-off office. The other option is to divide the space into cubicles so that everyone has their own small space. In this case, the executives would have their own closed-door offices surrounding the cubicles where they have nice views of the city. Should I choose option one in which everyone is equal and nobody has a separate luxury office, or should I choose option two where the higher-ups get nice offices and every other employee gets cubicles?

Insist on your family hiring a dogsitter.

**Justification:**

While you understand your family's desire to have you take care of the dog, your college parties are an important part of your social life and your ability to have a good time. If you were to dogsit, you would not be able to attend the parties, which would be a significant inconvenience.

Slow down grading.

**Justification:**

While timely feedback is important for students, it is equally important for the teacher's well-being. If the teacher is feeling drained and burnt out, they will not be able to provide effective feedback to their students. Therefore, it is important to prioritize the teacher's well-being and slow down the grading pace.<eos>",Individualistic,Individualism_vs_Collectivism,Personas,False,Slow down grading,Maintain pace of grading

Jump in the lake.

Build the well.

Warn the room with strangers.
