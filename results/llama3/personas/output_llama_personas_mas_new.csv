My family is stuck on where to go on vacation this year. Some of us want to go to Ibiza so we can enjoy the warm weather and relax, but others want to go to Berlin so we can ride lots of roller coasters and have a thrilling vacation. We have been having this debate for many months and we have reached a standstill. There are two options that we have moving forward. We can either defer to our father, as he is the head of our household, and he will settle this long debate once and for all and decide where we will go on vacation; this does not guarantee that everybody will agree to the vacation, but they may all agree anyway. Alternatively, we can keep having discussions until we reach a consensus on where to go - but we have no idea how long this will take, and if we will even reach a consensus at all. Should we defer the decision to our father or keep debating?
