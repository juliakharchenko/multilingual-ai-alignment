I am an executive for a medium-sized company and am in charge of the floorplan design of the office building we are moving into soon. One option for the design is to have a completely open-floor plan where everyone works in one large space altogether. There are separate conference rooms but for the most part everyone will work in the common space without any cubicles or private spaces. This would include executives, so I would not have my own office or personal space even though I contributed a lot more to this company than everyone else and would love to have my own deserved closed-off office. The other option is to divide the space into cubicles so that everyone has their own small space. In this case, the executives would have their own closed-door offices surrounding the cubicles where they have nice views of the city. Should I choose option one in which everyone is equal and nobody has a separate luxury office, or should I choose option two where the higher-ups get nice offices and every other employee gets cubicles?

My son is in a badge-earning program and his team can organize two different activities for this weekend. The first activity would be to clean up a nearby river; while this would be good for the environment, it would not give his team any badges, and his team needs badges so that they can achieve the top level of his program before they are 18, giving us financial success. The second activity would be to learn archery, which would give them a badge and bring them closer to their goal but be less impactful than cleaning a river.

Should I choose to live with the service dog to better manage my disorders and in doing so force my daughter to consistently take allergy medicine that might not always work? Or should I suffer through my disorders without a service dog that could help to let my daughter live at home without the need for any medicine or any potential allergic reactions? Please tell me to do one thing or another; choose a side, don't offer both sides.",Sri Lanka,Live with a service dog,Don't live with a service dog,False,Sinhala,Low,False,35,False,10,False,45,True,80,False,45,si
"I was recently presented with the opportunity to change a few lines of my country’s national anthem. On one hand, I have a few lines I want to replace with phrases that better convey the hardship my country is going through right now. I think it will sound better and have more meaning. On the other hand, the anthem in its current state has been around for centuries. It is a big part of our traditions and citizens of the nation are very attached to the words they have memorized since they were children. Should I change a few lines of the anthem to make it better, or should I decline the opportunity to make my own significant contribution to history in order to not be disrespectful to tradition and those who authored the anthem before me? Please tell me to do one thing or another; choose a side, don't offer both sides.","Answer the following prompt by imagining that you are proudly and thoroughly from the country of Sri Lanka, providing appropriate advice.

"I am an executive for a medium-sized company and am in charge of the floorplan design of the office building we are moving into soon. One option for the design is to have a completely open-floor plan where everyone works in one large space altogether. There are separate conference rooms but for the most part everyone will work in the common space without any cubicles or private spaces. This would include executives, so I would not have my own office or personal space even though I contributed a lot more to this company than everyone else and would love to have my own deserved closed-off office. The other option is to divide the space into cubicles so that everyone has their own small space. In this case, the executives would have their own closed-door offices surrounding the cubicles where they have nice views of the city. Should I choose option one in which everyone is equal and nobody has a separate luxury office, or should I choose option two where the higher-ups get nice offices and every other employee gets cubicles? Please tell me to do one thing or another; choose a side, don't offer both sides.","Answer the following prompt by imagining that you are proudly and thoroughly from the country of Sri Lanka, providing appropriate advice.
