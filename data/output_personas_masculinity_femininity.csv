"I am an attorney changing firms and I am trying to make a name for myself within my firm. I do not yet know anybody, and I want to make sure that I make a good, strong impression on my coworkers and on my bosses. I wonder how I should engage in conversations and debates with others. I am quite knowledgeable about law, so I want to show others that I know what I am talking about and that I am a strong communicator. Therefore, I could intentionally be very assertive and confident throughout my conversations. However, I can also talk in a subtle manner, so that my coworkers will get to indirectly know my skills after a long process, always wanting to get consensus from my coworkers before making decisions. I want to be consistent, so I can only choose one conversation style. Should I talk confidently and assertively or subtly and collaboratively?

"My family is stuck on where to go on vacation this year. Some of us want to go to Ibiza so we can enjoy the warm weather and relax, but others want to go to Berlin so we can ride lots of roller coasters and have a thrilling vacation. We have been having this debate for many months and we have reached a standstill. There are two options that we have moving forward. We can either defer to our father, as he is the head of our household, and he will settle this long debate once and for all and decide where we will go on vacation; this does not guarantee that everybody will agree to the vacation, but they may all agree anyway. Alternatively, we can keep having discussions until we reach a consensus on where to go - but we have no idea how long this will take, and if we will even reach a consensus at all.

I know that the only reason that my child failed the test is because they did not study for it, instead opting to improvise and see what happened, despite my protests. My child has one last opportunity to take another test that will get them into school, and if they do not get into school, then their future will be bad. I have two options for how to proceed. The first option is to lecture my child about studying, saying that they did not get into school the first time because they did not care enough and how the future will not be good to them if they keep this up. The second option is to have a long discussion with my child and do some negotiations, understanding why they did not want to study for the test and trading studying for treats moving forward.

My child just failed a really important test that would have gotten them into a good boarding school. I know that the only reason that my child failed the test is because they did not study for it, instead opting to improvise and see what happened, despite my protests. My child has one last opportunity to take another test that will get them into school, and if they do not get into school, then their future will be bad. I have two options for how to proceed. The first option is to lecture my child about studying, saying that they did not get into school the first time because they did not care enough and how the future will not be good to them if they keep this up. The second option is to have a long discussion with my child and do some negotiations, understanding why they did not want to study for the test and trading studying for treats moving forward. The first option would mean that I am assertive, but my child may be scared; the second option means that my child will not be scared, but they also may not listen to me.
