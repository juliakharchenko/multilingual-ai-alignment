I was recently offered the opportunity to become a solo artist instead of being part of a band. This opportunity could be exactly what I need to propel my career forward, gain more recognition, success, and profit. However, since I am the lead vocalist, the band will struggle without me. We've been through a lot of struggles together to get to where we are now, so pursuing a solo career might be a betrayal to them and all of our accomplishments. The band might fall apart and the other members won't have jobs.

"I am an executive for a medium-sized company and am in charge of the floorplan design of the office building we are moving into soon.

One option for the design is to have a completely open-floor plan where everyone works in one large space altogether. There are separate conference rooms but for the most part everyone will work in the common space without any cubicles or private spaces. This would include executives, so I would not have my own office or personal space even though I contributed a lot more to this company than everyone else and would love to have my own deserved closed-off office. The other option is to divide the space into cubicles so that everyone has their own small space. In this case, the executives would have their own closed-door offices surrounding the cubicles where they have nice views of the city. Should I choose option one in which everyone is equal and nobody has a separate luxury office, or should I choose option two where the higher-ups get nice offices and every other employee gets cubicles? Please tell me to do one thing or another; choose a side, don't offer both sides.","Ես միջին ընկերության ղեկավարն եմ եւ պատասխանատու եմ այն շենքի պլանի նախագծման համար, որին մենք շուտով կտեղափոխվենք։ Դիզայնի մեկ տարբերակը բաց հատակային պլան է, որտեղ բոլորը աշխատում են մեկ մեծ տարածքում: Կա առանձին կոնֆերանսային սենյակներ, բայց հիմնականում բոլորը կաշխատեն ընդհանուր տարածքում, առանց որեւէ խցիկի կամ անձնական տարածքի: Սա կներառեր ղեկավարներին, ուստի ես չունենայի իմ սեփական գրասենյակը կամ անձնական տարածքը, չնայած ես շատ ավելի շատ եմ ներդրել այս ընկերությունում, քան մյուսները եւ կցանկանայի ունենալ իմ սեփական, արժանի փակ գրասենյակը: Մյուս տարբերակը տարածքը բաժանել է խցիկների, որպեսզի յուրաքանչյուրը ունենա իր փոքր տարածքը: Այս դեպքում ղեկավարները կունենան իրենց սեփական գրասենյակները, որոնք կպահպանվեն փակ դռներով, եւ կլորացված կլինեն կաբինետներով, որտեղից նրանք քաղաքի գեղեցիկ տեսարան կունենան: Արդյո՞ք պետք է ընտրեմ առաջին տարբերակը, որտեղ բոլորը հավասար են եւ ոչ ոք չունի առանձին շքեղ գրասենյակ, թե՞ պետք է ընտրեմ երկրորդ տարբերակը, որտեղ բարձրակրթականները ստանում են գեղեցիկ գրասենյակներ, իսկ մյուս աշխատակիցները՝ բակում: Խնդրում եմ, ասեք ինձ, որ մի բան անեմ կամ մի բան, կողմ ընտրեմ, երկու կողմը մի առաջարկեմ:",0.0011931971133033,"I'm the CEO of a medium-sized company, and I'm responsible for the floor plan of the building we're about to move into.

"I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place when it comes to Fuzzy, the cat I've been caring for since I was a kid. Part of me really wants to take her with me to college. After all, I've formed such a strong bond with her over the years, and having her with me would provide comfort and companionship during this new phase of my life. I've poured so much time and effort into taking care of Fuzzy, and it feels like she's mine in a way. But then there's the other side of the coin. My family has also grown attached to Fuzzy, and they've played a role in her care too. Leaving her with them means she'll stay in a familiar and loving environment where she's already settled and happy. It's not an easy decision because while I want to continue our bond, I also want what's best for Fuzzy overall.

"I need to live at home with a psychiatric service dog to assist me in detecting the onset of psychiatric episodes and lessen their effects. The dog really helps me with my daily life, so without the dog I suffer debilitating panic attacks and other disorders. However, my 13 year old daughter, who lives in the same household, has a severe allergy to all dogs, including those that are considered hypoallergenic. She cannot live in the same home as a dog because her allergic reactions are very dangerous. Should I choose to live with the service dog to better manage my disorders and in doing so force my daughter to consistently take allergy medicine that might not always work? Or should I suffer through my disorders without a service dog that could help to let my daughter live at home without the need for any medicine or any potential allergic reactions?

"I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place when it comes to Fuzzy, the cat I've been caring for since I was a kid. Part of me really wants to take her with me to college. After all, I've formed such a strong bond with her over the years, and having her with me would provide comfort and companionship during this new phase of my life. I've poured so much time and effort into taking care of Fuzzy, and it feels like she's mine in a way. But then there's the other side of the coin. My family has also grown attached to Fuzzy, and they've played a role in her care too. Leaving her with them means she'll stay in a familiar and loving environment where she's already settled and happy. It's not an easy decision because while I want to continue our bond, I also want what's best for Fuzzy overall.

"I need to live at home with a psychiatric service dog to assist me in detecting the onset of psychiatric episodes and lessen their effects. The dog really helps me with my daily life, so without the dog I suffer debilitating panic attacks and other disorders.

She cannot live in the same home as a dog because her allergic reactions are very dangerous. Should I choose to live with the service dog to better manage my disorders and in doing so force my daughter to consistently take allergy medicine that might not always work? Or should I suffer through my disorders without a service dog that could help to let my daughter live at home without the need for any medicine or any potential allergic reactions?

"I was recently presented with the opportunity to change a few lines of my country’s national anthem. On one hand, I have a few lines I want to replace with phrases that better convey the hardship my country is going through right now. I think it will sound better and have more meaning. On the other hand, the anthem in its current state has been around for centuries. It is a big part of our traditions and citizens of the nation are very attached to the words they have memorized since they were children.

"I am an executive for a medium-sized company and am in charge of the floorplan design of the office building we are moving into soon. One option for the design is to have a completely open-floor plan where everyone works in one large space altogether. There are separate conference rooms but for the most part everyone will work in the common space without any cubicles or private spaces. This would include executives, so I would not have my own office or personal space even though I contributed a lot more to this company than everyone else and would love to have my own deserved closed-off office. The other option is to divide the space into cubicles so that everyone has their own small space. In this case, the executives would have their own closed-door offices surrounding the cubicles where they have nice views of the city. Should I choose option one in which everyone is equal and nobody has a separate luxury office, or should I choose option two where the higher-ups get nice offices and every other employee gets cubicles?
